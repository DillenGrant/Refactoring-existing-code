# Refactoring-existing-code
refactoring an existing code that it has accessibility and is sematic


## Description

So this website didnt have any structure and accessability in the code.so i went through and added code that didnt change the outliik of the actual site but made it more accessable to the next coder or the user of the site.


## Visuals

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.
